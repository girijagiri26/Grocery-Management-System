# Grocery-Management-System

The store management system is a comprehensive solution designed to handle the inventory, sales, and order management processes for small and medium-sized retail businesses. It leverages a MySQL database to store and manage critical business data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in daily operations. The system also features a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, a Python-based web framework, which allows store managers and staff to easily interact with the system.
This project focuses on bridging the gap between manual inventory tracking and automated order processing. By integrating real-time updates to stock levels, the application reduces errors and enhances operational efficiency. The system supports adding, updating, and managing products and orders while ensuring data consistency with robust backend logic.
By incorporating triggers within the database, the application automates processes like stock adjustments after order placement. This functionality eliminates the need for manual stock calculations, reducing the risk of errors. The accompanying web application simplifies interactions, making it accessible even for non-technical users.
Overall, the store management system aims to streamline retail operations, providing a reliable and scalable tool for managing day-to-day activities while supporting business growth.
